# CellularAutomaton

Cellular Automaton will be a console cellular automaton which allows user to choose the size of array and define many types of cells (for example might be a simulation with predators, herbivores and plants).

# Possibilities

The main point of this program is to find such structure which will let predators survive as many generations as possible in different environment sizes.
Anyway, you can also use it as normal cellural automaton (just to generate shapes) - in this case you have to set up only herbivores which will act like normal cellural automaton cells.
