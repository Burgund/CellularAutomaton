# CellularAutomaton

CellularAutomaton is a console cellular automaton which allows user to choose the size of an array and define where (and how many) herbivores and predators should appear

# Possibilities

The main point of this program is to find such structure which will let predators survive as many generations as possible in different environment sizes.
Anyway, you can also use it as normal cellural automaton (just to generate shapes) - in this case you have to set up only herbivores which will act like normal cellural automaton cells.
