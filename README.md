# CellularAutomaton

Cellular Automaton will be a console cellular automaton which allows user to choose the size of array and define many types of cells (for example might be a simulation with predators, herbivores and plants).

# Possibilities

The main point of this program is to find such structure which will let predators survive as many generations as possible in different environment sizes.
